# Sorting Algorithms Python
All generic sorting algorithms in Python 3.x Standard Library

> ## Bubble Sort 
>> Requirement:  
>> Python 3.x Standard Library
>
>> Time Complexity : O(n<sup>2</sup>)  
>> Space Complexity: O(1)

> ## Heap Sort 
>> Requirement:  
>> Python 3.x Standard Library
>
>> Time Complexity : O(nlog<sub>2</sub>n)  
>> Space Complexity: O(1)
>
>> Works best when new elements are repeatedly added  
>> or removed from the list.

> ## Insertion Sort 
>> Requirement:  
>> Python 3.x Standard Library
>
>> Time Complexity : O(n<sup>2</sup>)  
>> Space Complexity: O(1)

> ## Merge Sort 
>> Requirement:  
>> Python 3.x Standard Library
>
>> Time Complexity : O(nlog<sub>2</sub>n)  
>> Space Complexity: O(n)
>
>> Works best when "n" is significantly larger. Try using:  
>> import random  
>> A = random.sample(range(0, 255), 255)

> ## Quick Sort 
>> Requirement:  
>> Python 3.x Standard Library
>
>> Time Complexity : O(n<sup>2</sup>)  
>> Space Complexity: O(n)
>
>> Works best when pivot chosen is the population median

> ## Selection Sort 
>> Requirement:  
>> Python 3.x Standard Library
>
>> Time Complexity : O(n<sup>2</sup>)  
>> Space Complexity: O(1)
